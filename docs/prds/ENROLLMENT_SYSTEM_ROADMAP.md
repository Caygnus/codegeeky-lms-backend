## 🔄 API Workflow Summary

### **Standard Enrollment Flow**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as API
    participant R as Razorpay
    participant W as Webhook

    U->>F: Click "Enroll"
    F->>A: POST /enrollments/initialize
    A->>R: Create Order
    R-->>A: Order Details
    A-->>F: Enrollment + Payment Session
    F->>R: Open Checkout
    U->>R: Complete Payment
    R->>W: Payment Webhook
    W->>A: Update Enrollment
    A-->>F: Enrollment Complete
    F-->>U: Course Access Granted
```

### **Key API Calls Order**

1. **Course Information**: `GET /api/v1/internships/{courseId}`
2. **Initialize Enrollment**: `POST /api/v1/enrollments/initialize`
3. **Process Payment**: Frontend Razorpay integration
4. **Webhook Processing**: Backend payment confirmation
5. **Status Check**: `GET /api/v1/enrollments/{id}/status`
6. **Course Access**: `GET /api/v1/courses/{courseId}/access`

## 💰 Razorpay Integration Deep Dive

### **Order Creation Strategy**

```go
func (r *RazorpayProvider) CreateEnrollmentOrder(ctx context.Context, req *EnrollmentPaymentRequest) (*OrderResponse, error) {
    orderData := map[string]interface{}{
        "amount":          req.Amount * 100, // Convert to paise
        "currency":        req.Currency,
        "receipt":         req.IdempotencyKey,
        "payment_capture": 1, // Auto-capture
        "notes": map[string]string{
            "enrollment_id": req.EnrollmentID,
            "course_id":     req.CourseID,
            "user_id":       req.UserID,
        },
    }

    return r.razorpayClient.Order.Create(orderData, nil)
}
```

### **Webhook Processing**

```go
func (w *WebhookHandler) HandlePaymentSuccess(event *RazorpayEvent) error {
    enrollmentID := event.Payload.Order.Notes["enrollment_id"]

    // Update payment status
    payment.Status = "completed"
    payment.GatewayPaymentID = event.Payload.Payment.ID

    // Complete enrollment
    enrollment.Status = "enrolled"
    enrollment.EnrolledAt = time.Now()

    // Grant course access
    return w.grantCourseAccess(enrollmentID)
}
```

### **Frontend Integration**

```javascript
// Complete enrollment flow
const enrollCourse = async (courseId) => {
  // 1. Initialize enrollment
  const enrollment = await initializeEnrollment(courseId);

  // 2. Process payment (if required)
  if (enrollment.payment_required) {
    await processRazorpayPayment(enrollment.payment_session);
  }

  // 3. Verify completion
  const status = await checkEnrollmentStatus(enrollment.enrollment_id);

  // 4. Redirect to course
  if (status.enrollment_status === "enrolled") {
    window.location.href = status.course_access.next_lesson_url;
  }
};
```
